# What is a room?

---

In **Colir**, a room is your go-to spot for secure chats. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Definition**: It's a virtual space for encrypted communication, like a private meeting area.

2. **Creation**: Anyone can create a room and set the encryption key. The key stays on your device, not our servers.

3. **Identification**: Each room gets a unique GUID (Globally Unique Identifier). Share this to invite others.

4. **Access**: To join, you need the room's GUID and the correct encryption key.

5. **Encryption**: All chats in a room are end-to-end encrypted. You can change the key anytime.

6. **Features**: Each room has a voice channel for encrypted audio chats and supports text messages.

7. **Expiry**: Set an expiry date for rooms. After that, all data becomes inaccessible and is deleted.

8. **Privacy**: We only store and transfer encrypted data. Without the right key, it's unreadable.

9. **Storage**: Each room has **100MB** of storage for files. Once full, you can't upload more until you free up space.

Rooms in Colir give you a secure, flexible space for private chats, keeping your conversations under wraps.
