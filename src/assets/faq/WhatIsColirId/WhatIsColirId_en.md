A Colir Id (also called the Hex Id) is a unique identifier assigned to each user in the Colir platform. Here's what you need to know about Colir Ids:

1. **Definition**:
   - A Colir Id is a 6-symbol hexadecimal number.
   - It serves as a unique identifier for each user within the Colir system.

2. **Format**:
   - Consists of 6 characters.
   - Uses hexadecimal digits (0-9 and A-F).
   - Example: 1A2B3C

3. **Purpose**:
   - Provides a way to uniquely identify users within the platform.
   - Allows for user recognition without revealing personal information.

4. **Assignment**:
   - Automatically generated and assigned when a user first authenticates with the system.
   - Remains constant for the user across different sessions.

5. **Usage**:
   - Can be used to identify users within rooms.
   - Might be used for features like adding friends or directing messages.

6. **Privacy**:
   - The Colir Id doesn't contain or reveal any personal information about the user.
   - It's designed to maintain user anonymity while still providing a unique identifier.

7. **Persistence**:
   - For users authenticated via GitHub or Google, the Colir Id remains consistent across logins.
   - For anonymous users, a new Colir Id is generated each time, as these are one-time authentications.

8. **Visibility**:
   - Users can see their own Colir Id.
   - Other users in the same room may be able to see each other's Colir Ids.

9. **Security**:
   - Knowing someone's Colir Id doesn't grant any access to their account or messages.
   - It's safe to share your Colir Id with others if needed.

The Colir Id system allows for user identification within the platform while maintaining the core principles of privacy and security that Colir is built upon.
