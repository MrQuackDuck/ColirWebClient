## Logo

**Colir** has two versions of the logo:

- **Miniature version**: a brush icon, partially colored in 4 bright colors on the right. This version of the logo is inspired by the brush icon from [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/brush).
- **Full version**: the text **Colir** with the letter **"o"** in the middle colored in 4 bright colors and **"i"** decorated as a brush.

The idea of bright coloring of part of the logo is inspired by the appearance of the **Seychelles flag** ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¨.\
Logo colors: **#FF0000**, **#FFC701**, **#0864FB**, **#14C35A**, **#FFFFFF**/**#1E293B** (dark/light interface theme).
