# ðŸ“Š How statistics work?

---

**Colir** keeps stats simple and private:

1. **What we collect**:

   - We track basic activity like messages sent and rooms joined.
   - Only you can see your personal stats.

2. **Your choice**:
   - Don't want us to collect stats? No problem. **You can turn it off** in settings.

We aim to give you useful insights while respecting your privacy.
