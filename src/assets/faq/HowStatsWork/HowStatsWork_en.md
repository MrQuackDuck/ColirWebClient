# How statistics work?

---

Colir's approach to statistics is designed to maintain user privacy while providing useful insights. Here's how statistics work in Colir:

1. **Privacy-First Approach**:
   - All statistics are collected and processed with a strong emphasis on user privacy.
   - No personal or identifiable information is used in statistical calculations.

2. **Encrypted Data**:
   - Since all user data is end-to-end encrypted, the server cannot access or analyze the content of messages.
   - This means that content-based statistics (like most used words) are not possible.

3. **Metadata Collection**:
   - Statistics are primarily based on metadata - information about the data, not the data itself.
   - This includes things like message timestamps, room creation dates, and user activity times.

4. **Anonymized Data**:
   - All data used for statistics is anonymized before processing.
   - User IDs or Colir Ids are not linked to the statistical data.

5. **Aggregate Statistics**:
   - Most statistics are presented in aggregate form.
   - For example, total number of messages sent across the platform, or average number of users per room.

6. **Time-Based Analytics**:
   - Statistics may include time-based analytics, such as peak usage hours or busiest days of the week.
   - These are calculated without linking to specific users or rooms.

7. **Room Statistics**:
   - Basic statistics for individual rooms may be available to room members.
   - This could include number of messages, active users, or room lifespan.

8. **Opt-Out Options**:
   - Users may have the option to opt-out of non-essential data collection for statistics.
   - Essential data (like that needed for service operation) will still be collected.

9. **Transparency**:
   - Colir is committed to being transparent about what data is collected and how it's used for statistics.
   - Users can refer to the privacy policy for detailed information.

10. **Security Measures**:
    - All statistical data is stored securely and separately from user data.
    - Access to statistical data is strictly limited and monitored.

11. **Compliance**:
    - All statistical processes comply with relevant data protection regulations.

By focusing on anonymized metadata and aggregate data, Colir aims to provide useful insights into platform usage while maintaining the highest standards of user privacy and data protection.
