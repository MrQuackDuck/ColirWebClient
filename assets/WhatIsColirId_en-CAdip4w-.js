---

A **Colir Id** (or _Hex Id_) is your unique username in **Colir**. Here's what you should know:

1. **What it is**: A 6-character code using numbers 0-9 and letters A-F.

2. **Example**: Something like **#F4CA16**

3. **Purpose**: It's how we identify you without using personal info.

4. **How you get it**:

   - If you sign in with **GitHub** or **Google**, you can pick from a few options we generate with ability to regenerate. Still, once you pick one, it can't be changed.
   - For anonymous sign-ins, we assign a random one without giving a choice.

5. **Using it**: It's how others see you in rooms and might be used for adding friends or direct messages.

6. **Privacy**: It doesn't reveal any personal info about you.

7. **Consistency**:

   - If you use GitHub or Google, your Id stays the same each time you log in.
   - Anonymous users get a new Id each time.

8. **Who can see it**: You can see your own, and others in the same room might see it too.

9. **Security**: Knowing someone's Colir Id doesn't give access to their account or messages.

The **Colir Id** lets us identify users while keeping things private and secure.
