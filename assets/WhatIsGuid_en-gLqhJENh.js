---

In **Colir**, a GUID is key to finding and joining rooms. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Definition**: GUID stands for Globally Unique Identifier. It's a unique number used to identify stuff in software.

2. **What it looks like**: It's a 32-character string of letters and numbers, like this: 870280c0-c112-4766-a055-ada5161ac7e6

3. **Purpose**: Each room in Colir has its own GUID. Think of it as the room's address.

4. **Sharing**: You can share a room's GUID with others to invite them. It's safe to share openly.

5. **Access**: Knowing a GUID lets you try to join a room, but you still need the encryption key to read messages.

6. **Privacy**: The GUID doesn't reveal anything about what's in the room or who's there.

7. **Creation**: We generate GUIDs automatically when you create a new room.

8. **How to use it**: You don't need to understand the tech behind GUIDs. Just think of it as the "code" to find a specific room.

In short, the GUID is like a room number or address in **Colir**. It helps you find the right room without compromising the security of what's inside.
